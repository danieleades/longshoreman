## Usage

```rust
use longshoreman::{Docker, Result};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let docker = Docker::new();

    // Pull an image
    docker.images().pull("ubuntu").tag("latest").send().await?;

    // Create a container
    let id = docker
        .containers()
        .create("ubuntu")
        .name("my-container")
        .send()
        .await?
        .id;

    // Remove the container
    docker
        .containers()
        .remove(id)
        .force(true)
        .send()
        .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Design

This little Docker client started life as an attempt to drag [Shiplift](https://github.com/softprops/shiplift) up to date, but it grew arms and legs.

There's not many endpoints implemented just yet, but my aim is that as they're added, they are well-tested and strongly-typed.

it's early days, and i'm happy to accept notes of interest in particular endpoints, as well as pull requests.

- async/await support built on top of `std::future::Future`
- pure Rust, sits on top of the battle-tested [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) HTTP client
- builder API- only use the methods you need, less types to explicitly bring into scope.
  
## Contributing

- Given the sheer number of endpoint which exist, and the number of options available for each, I'm absolutely depending on pull requests to help me tackle some of these
- the complicated logic of request handling is centralised, simplifying the implementation of the individual endpoints
- i'm unlikely to accept pull requests that do not have unit tests. Later, I would also like comprehensive integration tests for *each* endpoint. (this is tricky initially, because combinations of multiple endpoints will be required in order to create meaningful integration tests)
