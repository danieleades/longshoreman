This little Docker client started life as an attempt to drag Shiplift up to date, but it grew arms and legs.

There's not many endpoints implemented but my aim is that they're implemented REALLY WELL.

it's early days, and i'm happy to accept notes of interest in particular endpoints, as well as pull requests.
